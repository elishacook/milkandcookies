Milk & Cookies is a PHP application development library. It's goal is to remove
as much drudgery as possible from web application development without
enforcing a particular methodology. To that end, most of what you will find here
are standalone libraries crafted to solve a particular problem or implement a pattern.

This project was created by Elisha Cook in 2006 and has been in continuous
production use since that time. This is the third major version.
