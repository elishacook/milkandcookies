Milk & Cookies is a PHP application development library. Its goal is to remove
as much drudgery as possible from web application development without
enforcing the use of a large framework. Here you will find tools that make writing web
services fast and fun, help tie together your system into simple, consistent APIs,
leverage PHP's innate templating abilities and produce well-optimized web pages
without a lot of mucking about.

This project was created by Elisha Cook in 2006 and has been in continuous
production use since that time. This is the third major version.

NOTE - This version is a major refactoring and major components are still in progress.
